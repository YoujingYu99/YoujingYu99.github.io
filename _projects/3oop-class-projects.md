4. A point is awarded to the winner of the round.
5. Gameplay continues until either the player or the computer reach 3 rounds won in which the winner of the game is determined.

Speech Synthesizer
-----
Computer voices always sound a bit off. The words are familiar, yet their tempo and articulation are unlike any commonly spoken English. A speech synthesizer provides the perfect balance between eeriness and comfort to make you laugh.

This program implements a speech sythesizer to read a song's lyrics from a .txt file.
