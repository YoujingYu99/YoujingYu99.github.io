* Joined the Web Intelligence Research Group and supervised by Dr Aldo Lipani. Check out https://wi.cs.ucl.ac.uk/index.php/people/ 
* Worked on speech and text-based user confidence and expertise detection and measurement in conversational search systems (CSS) using transformer-based multimodal deep neural networks.
* Prepared a dataset of user queries named UNSURE from Spotify Podcast, with the use of the word-level transcript to segment out questions.
* Crowdsourced using Amazon Mturk service to obtain confidence scores based on the segmented audio files. Performed quality control on collected answers and conducted user agreement analysis.
* Trained a text and audio multimodal regression network using pretrained BERT and HuBERT models to predict human confidence scores. Our model showed a human-level performance in confidence score prediction.
* Paper published at International Conference on Engineering Applications of Neural Networks (EANN). Check it out <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-62495-7_31">here</a>!
