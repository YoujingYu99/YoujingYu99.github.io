* Joined a research group named the Managing Air for Inner Greater Cities (MAGIC) where the broad aim is to develop cities with no air pollution and no heat-island effect. The subgroup directed by Professor Adam Boies targets identifying modes of pollution resulting from different car models.
* My job was to identify car plate numbers and hence car models from video footage and hence determine the pollution output from each car model and the pollution that enters the surrounding buildings.  I wrote a machine-learning algorithm for detecting UK car plate numbers from videos using computer vision packages such as OpenCV and Pytesseract. Data cleaning was performed using maximum likelihood inference.
