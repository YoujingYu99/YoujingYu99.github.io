* Joined the Neural Dynamics and Control (NDC) group directed by Dr Guillaume Hennequin.
* Our task is to implement a webcam-based eye tracker to track the user's eye movements on screen in psychophysical experiments to better understand human thinking when solving challenges.
* Using ideas from human physiology, we implemented an online process that dynamically tracks environment variables such as the user’s viewing distance from the screen with one initial simple calibration task.
* Based on WebGazer, we map from the user’s eye images in the camera stream (from TensorFlow Facemesh) to eyeball rotation angles using Gaussian Processes regression with a novel proposed kernel.
* Our implementation shows a 22% reduction in error in prediction of gaze location of user compared to the original WebGazer. <a href="http://YoujingYu99.github.io/files/Report_eyetracker.pdf" target="_blank">View My Report</a>.
