* The goal of the project is to identify and predict building damage and forest fires from satellite images. We built an ML-Enhanced Computer Vision Change Detector System for Satellite Images Analysis. We wrote a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for difference image detection for satellite building, forest fire and oil spill images. I was the team leader of the unsupervised learning team.
