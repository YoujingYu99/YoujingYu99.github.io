* I joined the Managing Air for Green Inner Cities (MAGIC) research group, where the aim is to develop cities with no air pollution and no heat-island effect. My job was to identify car plate numbers and hence models from video footage and   hence determine the pollution output by the models and the pollution that enters the surrounding buildings.  I wrote a machine-learning algorithm for detecting UK car plate numbers from videos using computer vision packages such as OpenCV and Pytesseract.
