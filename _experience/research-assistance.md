Designed and built an electric vehicle and a current sensor printed circuit board to test a proof-of-concept bi-directional grid-compatible power converter.

What is a bi-directional grid-compatible power converter?
------
The Universal and Scalable Smart Grid Power Converter (USSGPC) is intended to allow for AC or DC power at a variable voltage and frequency to be sourced or consumed to or from the grid.
* This allows home batteries (like the Tesla Powerwall) or battery-powered electric vehicles to source power to the grid during power outages or brownouts.

The device is smart grid capable, allowing communication between converters and utility companies.
* Communication between power sourcing converters and utility companies can reduce the need for peaker plants, which run at reduced efficiency to start up quickly.

Electric Vehicle Design
------
Designed and built an electric recumbent tricycle to test the USSGPC. This involved:
* Learning about the CAN communication protocol.
* Assembling a 48V 20AH Li-Ion battery and battery monitoring system.
* Various metalworking and fabrication tasks including:
  * Designing and fabricating a battery tray, during which, learning to TIG weld.
  * Designing and fabricating a controller mount.
  * Turning and milling a shaft with a keyway.
* 3D modeling frame mounts in Fusion 360 for peripherals including switches, a display, and a key.
* Wiring the battery to the controller and the controller to the peripherals.
* Keeping a well-maintained engineering notebook.
* Communicating individual progress to a cross-functional team on a weekly basis.
* Providing technical documentation including project references and reports.

Printed Circuit Board Design
------
Designed a PCB in Altium to measure the current passing through the converter. This involved:
* Creating schematic symbol libraries and drawing schematics.
* Creating footprints and adding 3D models.
* Placing components and routing traces.
* Running design rule checks and debugging.
* Generating output files such as PDFs of schematics and 3D models, Gerber and drill files, and a bill of materials.
* Collaborating with graduate students to make more-informed design choices.
