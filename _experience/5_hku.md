* Our goal is to generated holography images using deep learning techniques. We used TensorFlow to build various neural networks such as convolutional neural networks (CNN), ResNet, Wide ResNet, DenseNet and SqueezeNet. We performed image to image translations with Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) structures on hologram images.
