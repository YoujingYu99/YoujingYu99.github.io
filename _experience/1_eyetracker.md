*Joined the Neural Dynamics and Control (NDC) group under Dr Guillaume Hennequin. Our task is to implement a webcam-based eye tracker to track the user's eye movements when solving a maze to better understand human thinking when solving challenges. Our first step is track eye movement when the maze is of full observability to the user.
* Supervisor: Dr Guillaume Hennequin
