* Leader of a student team of three members.
* The goal of the project is to produce nano encapsulated organic chemicals for coating. The coating should ideally be able to self-cleaning (dust-resistant) and thermal insulating. Our Cadmium Orthostannate nanoparticles with 3-(mercaptopropyl)trimethoxysilane suspended in organic solution were shown to have effective thermal insulation abilities, which can save massive amounts of energy if painted on windows.
