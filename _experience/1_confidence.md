* Currently working on confidence and user expertise detection and measurement on different conversational search systems (CSS) through common-sense reasoning in Natural Language Processing (NLP) using transformer-based multimodal deep neural networks. The dataset of user queries was prepared from from Spotify Podcast, with the use of the word-level transcript to segment out questions. Feature extraction was done on the audio on energy entropy, spectral centroids, zero-crossing rate, chroma CQT etc. We crowdsourced using Amazon Mturk service to obtain confidence scores based on audio files.
