* Currently working on speech and text-based user confidence and expertise detection and measurement on conversational search systems (CSS) in Natural Language Processing (NLP) using transformer-based multimodal deep neural networks. The dataset of user queries was prepared from Spotify Podcast, with the use of the word-level transcript to segment out questions. Feature extraction was done on the audio on energy entropy, spectral centroids, zero-crossing rate, chroma CQT etc. We crowdsourced using Amazon Mturk service to obtain confidence scores based on audio files. We then trained a text and audio multimodal regression network using pretrained BERT and HuBERT models to predict human confidence scores. Our model showed a human-level performance in confidence score prediction.
