Hello friends! My name is Youjing Yu, a fourth year student specialising in Information Engineering at the University of Cambridge. I have done research in modern holography, computer vision, and natural language processing (NLP) and am fortunate to be advised by Dr Aldo Lipani on my research project on confidence detection in conversational search systems and by Dr Guillaume Hennequin in my Masters' project on Webcam-based Eye Tracking for Psychophysics Experiments. Currently I am hoping to pursue a PhD in NLP, on educational chatbots. Feel free to get in touch if you want to know more about me! Checkout my research experiences, extra-curricular activities, courses taken and cv if you are interested!
