I am a computer engineering graduate who loves to make things. I am fascinated by what can be accomplished by human ingenuity. Computers give people the ability to accomplish amazing tasks and can facilitate matters in their lives. Being able to contribute to a technology that has so much potential to help others and benefit society excites me. I have always loved designing things that are useful and tangible, which is what led me to my fondness for programming. I love the process of learning new things and want to be able to continually grow my knowledge as tech changes over the years. In the future, I would love to work on a smart-grid system that uses the IoT to decrease CO<sub>2</sub> emissions or program electric vehicles to contribute to decreasing the number of gasoline automobiles on the road.
