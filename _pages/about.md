Hello friends! My name is Youjing Yu, a fourth year student specialising in Information Engineering at the Universityof Cambridge. I have done research in modern holography, computer vision, and natural language processing (NLP) and am fortunate to be advised by Dr Guillaume Hennequin in my Masters' project on Webcam-based Eye Tracking for Psychophysics Experiments. Currently I am hoping to pursue a PhD in NLP, on educational chatbots. Feel free to get in touch if you want to know more about me! Checkout my research experiences below.
