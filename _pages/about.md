Hello friends! My name is Youjing Yu, currently a PhD student supervised by Dr Guillaume Hennequin at the University of Cambridge. I have done research in modern holography, computer vision, and natural language processing (NLP). I am fortunate to have been advised by Dr Aldo Lipani on my research project on confidence detection in conversational search systems and by Dr Guillaume Hennequin on my Masters' project on Webcam-based Eye Tracking for Psychophysics Experiments. 

In my free time, I have been a member of choir, chinese orchestra, tennis team and badminton team. I also play Guzheng (an ancient Chinese instrument) and the violin, and have been taking German lessons for four years. Feel free to get in touch if you want to know more about me! And don't forget to check out my research experiences, extra-curricular activities, courses taken and CV here!
