Education
======
* MEng in Information Engineering, Univeristy of Cambridge, 2023 (expected)
* A-Levels, Science Stream, Hwa Chong Institution, 2018
* Secondary Education, Science Stream, Anderson Secondary School, 2016

Work experience
======
* Summer 2022: Research Assistant
  * University College London, Department of Computer Science.
  * Currently working on confidence and user expertise detection and measurement on different conversational search systems (CSS) through common-sense reasoning in Natural Language Processing (NLP) using transformer-based multimodal deep neural networks.
  * Supervisor: Dr Aldo Lipani

* Summer 2021: Research Intern
  * University of Cambridge, Department of Engineering
  * Developed a web-based interface for Natural Language Processing(NLP) text corpora that enables gender biases to be revealed visually and interactively.A Flask-based web framework was created where the user can upload their corpora through inputting plain text, URL or txt files. Two NLP algorithms will run, namely the Bias Score Calculation algorithm based on word embedding and sentence parsing. Bias scores associated with each token and specific sentence structures are returned to the user. Interactive pivot tables, bar graphs, word clouds, PCA and TSNE graphs are provided for the user to explore and extract information.
  * Supervisor: Dr Marcus Tomalin
